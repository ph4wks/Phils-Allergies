Over the years since being diagnosed with some rather complex food intollerances I've learned a lot about the ingredients of both off the shelf foods and what is served in many restaurants.  Both family and friends who want to cook something, find a restaurant or book a set menu meal can really struggle so below I'm publishing the details and hopefully some easy alternatives.

The 3 food groups I can't eat are:
- Wheat (i.e. gluten)
- Dairy (i.e. cows milk products)
- Yeast (i.e. anything that is brewed, fermented, risen or naturally contains or is a fungus)

## Dairy ##
**NOTE:** This is nothing to do with Lactose
