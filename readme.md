Over the years since being diagnosed with some rather complex food intollerances I've learned a lot about the ingredients of both off the shelf foods and what is served in many restaurants.  Both family and friends who want to cook something, find a restaurant or book a set menu meal can really struggle so below I'm publishing the details and hopefully some easy alternatives.

The 3 food groups I need to avoid are:
- Wheat (i.e. gluten)
- Dairy (i.e. cows milk products)
- Yeast (i.e. anything that is brewed, fermented, risen or naturally contains or is a fungus)

Since it was written into law that restaurants and producers in the UK must declare several government selected 'allergens' on packaging and menus, Gluten and Dairy are well noted and easy to avoid.  However yeast is not yet one of those selected allergens and so can be quite difficult to avoid, especially since it occurs naturally all over the place and is put in all sorts of things as either an enhancer or a preservative in the form or Yeast Extract.
